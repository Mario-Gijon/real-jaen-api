"""Plan of the Primera Federación Group 2 recipe (sofascore-group2-2627-v1): pure functions of the published
inventory, the rows of the round pages just listed and the time. No network, no SDK, no store.

Design and decisions: docs/diseno-receta-grupo2.md. In short:

1. Rounds to list. Near rounds (a current match not finished whose start has passed or is within 7 days, a
   postponed match, or a finished match still inside the 72 h window) and, in rotation, the FAR_ROUNDS_PER_RUN
   other rounds with matches still to play whose calendar was checked longest ago (far calendar changes).
2. Matches to consult, in priority order, within the budget:
   pending    finished in the inventory with a section missing (an earlier update left it pending)
   finished   the listing shows finished and the inventory does not have it finished (whatever its age: a result
              recovered outside the 72 h window too), postponed matches recovered included
   changed    the listing differs from the inventory (identity, status, score, start): a correction or a far
              calendar change; a match not finished only needs its event
   refresh    finished, observed before 72 h after kick-off and at least 6 h ago (the SDK's refresh_due rule)
   Whatever does not fit stays pending with reason "budget" for the next update.

An empty answer, a 404 or an error never means "no data" here: the section stays pending, never zero.
