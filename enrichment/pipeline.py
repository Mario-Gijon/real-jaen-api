    The original comment mapping is passed to ``enrich_comment`` so participant

    their supported original types; all other types receive an empty attributes
    mapping. This function treats each comment independently and never joins
    related events.

    For a clearly identified own goal, the structured participant keeps its
    ``source_role`` and ``source_id`` but receives the integrated role
    ``own_goal_author``. Its original normalizer role is retained in
    ``normalizer_role`` for traceability, preventing it from being treated as an
    ordinary scorer downstream. Text-only assistant names remain attributes and
    are never added as participants or assigned IDs.
